Different approaches to web scraping in different websites respectively.
The two different approaches are:
- In Flipkart searches
- In Github scraping according to topics
1. In Flipkart a user uses the URL used to search a product in the 'search bar' on the flipkart website. The scraper will use that URL and extract all the data displayed by the website aboout all the products that are listed on that webpage and make a csv out of that file. 
2. In this the program scraps all the different repositories that are there and sort them out according to their types and further different repos.
